# ssgprtune
The Sparse Spectrum Gaussian Process for Regression (SSGPR) implementation has been moved to a [dedicated repository](https://github.com/agijsberts/ssgpr/).  The `tune.py` example in that repository covers the functionality that was previously provided in `ssgprtune.py`, namely training, hyperparameter optimization, and testing of SSGPR models that can be saved and imported in this `learningMachine` module.

For more information on installation and usage, please see https://github.com/agijsberts/ssgpr/.
